`JIGSAW` is a computational library for unstructured mesh generation; designed to generate high-quality Delaunay triangulations and polyhedral decompositions of general planar, surface and volumetric domains. `JIGSAW` includes both `refinement`-based algorithms for the construction of new meshes, as well as `optimisation`-driven techniques designed to improve existing grids.

This package provides the underlying `C++` source for `JIGSAW`; defining a basic command-line interface and a `C`-format `API`. A <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">`MATLAB`</a> / <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave">`OCTAVE`</a> based scripting interface, including a range of additional facilities for file I/O, mesh visualisation and post-processing operations can be found <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-matlab">here</a>.

`JIGSAW` has been compiled and tested on various `64-bit` `Linux` , `Windows` and `Mac` based platforms. 


## `Code Structure`

`JIGSAW` is written as a `header-only` library in `C++`. Both a basic command-line interface and a `C`-format `API` are defined:

      JIGSAW::
      ├── src -- JIGSAW src code
      ├── inc -- JIGSAW header files (for libjigsaw)
      ├── bin -- put JIGSAW exe binaries here
      ├── lib -- put JIGSAW lib binaries here
      ├── geo -- geometry definitions and input data
      ├── out -- default folder for JIGSAW output
      └── uni -- unit tests and libjigsaw example programs

## `Getting Started`

The first step is to compile the code! The `JIGSAW` src can be found in <a href="../master/src/">`../jigsaw/src/`</a>.

`JIGSAW` is a `header-only` package - there is only the single main `jigsaw.cpp` file that simply `#include`'s the rest of the library as headers. The resulting build process should be fairly straight-forward as a result. `JIGSAW` does not currently dependent on any external packages or libraries.

#### `On Linux/Mac`

`JIGSAW` has been successfully built using various versions of the `g++` and `llvm` compilers. Since the build process is a simple one-liner, there's no `make` script - instead:

	g++ -std=c++11 -pedantic -Wall -s -O3 -flto -D NDEBUG -I libcpp -static-libstdc++ 
	jigsaw.cpp -o jigsaw64r
	
can be used to build a `JIGSAW` executable, while:

	g++ -std=c++11 -pedantic -Wall -O3 -flto -fPIC -D NDEBUG -I libcpp -static-libstdc++ 
	jigsaw.cpp -shared -o libjigsaw64r.so

can be used to build a `JIGSAW` shared library. See the headers in <a href="../master/inc/">`../jigsaw/inc/`</a> for details on the `API`. The `#define __lib_jigsaw` directive in `jigsaw.cpp` toggles the source between executable and shared-library modes.

#### `On Windows`

`JIGSAW` has been successfully built using various versions of the `msvc` compiler. I do not provide a sample `msvc` project, but the following steps can be used to create one:

	* Create a new, empty MSVC project.
	* Import the jigsaw.cpp file, this contains the main() entry-point.
	* Modify the MSVC project settings to include the "../src/" and "../src/libcpp/" directories.

#### `Folder Structure`

Once you have built the `JIGSAW` binaries, place them in the appropriate sub-folders in`../jigsaw/bin/` and/or `../jigsaw/lib/` directories, so that they can be found by the unit tests in `../jigsaw/uni/`.

## `A Simple Example`

After compiling the code, run the following command-line example to get started:
````
On WIN-64 platforms:

\bin\WIN-64\jigsaw64r.exe example.jig

On LNX-64 platforms:

/bin/LNX-64/jigsaw64r     example.jig
````
In this example, a high-quality tetrahedral mesh is generated for the 'stanford-bunny' geometry and the result is written to file. The input geometry is specified as a triangulated surface, and is read from `../jigsaw/geo/bunny.msh`. The volume and surface mesh outputs are written to `../jigsaw/out/bunny.msh`. Edit `example.jig` for a description of `JIGSAW`'s configuration options.
